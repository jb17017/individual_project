#This repo outlines a project with the mission of identifying toxicity in in-game video game text chat logs.

I used Google's BERT language model to achieve this.

My implementation builds off of the previous work from this tutorial: https://github.com/aniruddhachoudhury/BERT-Tutorials/blob/master/Blog%202/BERT_Fine_Tuning_Sentence_Classification.ipynb

It uses datasets obtained by external sources, the OLID dataset and the GOSU.AI Dota 2 dataset,
The OLID dataset was obtained from here: https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/olid
The GOSU.AI Dota 2 dataset was obtained from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romovpa/gosuai-dota-2-game-chats?select=dota2_chat_messages.csv

The implementation can be found in the Machine learning implementation folder.
